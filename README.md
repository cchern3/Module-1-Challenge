# Module-1-Challenge
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this Module-1-Challenge is to refactor the starter code in order to create a concise codebase that follows accessibility standards and will display a website that is optimized for search engines. During this challenge, non-semantic elements were identified to be replaced with more semantic elements; the codebase was improved to follow a logical structure; and accessible alt and heading attributes were placed in sequential order. 

## Usage
To examine and view the refactored code, click the URL at the bottom of the READ.ME under "link to deployed application", then open the Chrome DevTools by pressing 'Command+Option+I' (MacOS) or 'Control+Shift+I' (Windows) or right clicking and selecting 'Inspect'. The console panel will be displayed in the webpage where you can read through the source code and CSS.
